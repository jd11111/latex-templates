### Simple Latex Template
This is a simple latex template for a science article/thesis.
Most suitable for math/physics.  

To compile, simply type ```latexmk -pdf``` while in the main directory.
Requires the latex "stack".
On linux your distros package named some variation of "texlive full" should do the job.
